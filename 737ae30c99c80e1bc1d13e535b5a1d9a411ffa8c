      "message": "This assumes that you will always get the bdev examine notifications in the same order.  This is not guaranteed.  For example, first time you may get Nvme0n1 and then Nvme1n1.  Next time you may get Nvme1n1 then Nvme0n1.  The nvme driver initializes the SSDs in parallel, so it is possible (even likely) that the SSDs may initialize in different amounts of time.",
